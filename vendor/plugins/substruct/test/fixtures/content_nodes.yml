    <p>According to the creator of scientology: Stemming from his belief that birth is a trauma that may induce engrams, he stated that the delivery room should be as silent as possible and that words should be avoided because any words used during birth might be reassociated by adults with their earlier traumatic birth experience.</p>

  content: "For who don't know about it: On April 1st of each year, James Randi Educational Foundation award the coveted Pigasus awards in variable categories, for accomplishments in the previous year. The awards are announced via telepathy, winners are allowed to predict their victories, and the Flying Pig trophies are sent via psychokinesis. We send; if they don't receive, that's probably due to their lack of paranormal talent."
