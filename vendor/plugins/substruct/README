#summary How to install Substruct

= Installing Substruct =

== Introduction ==

_Substruct is not meant for end users or novices to install_.

This is a software program made for professional web developers.
If you don't have experience developing software you could be extremely frustrated by this process.

*These directions assume you already have a working Rails hosting environment. This means...*
 * A way to run Rails
   * Webrick (included with Rails)
   * Apache / Mod_rails
 * MySQL
 * Ruby
 * Rails
 * Rubygems

These directions _also_ assume you have some familiarity with developing Rails applications in general and a working knowledge of your file system.



== Installation ==

=== 1. Install Imagemagick ===

Imagemagick is required to resize image files that are uploaded for your products and content.

There are various ways to install it, depending on the operating system you're running.

[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php Here's a link on how to compile ImageMagick from source]

This example probably doesn't cover every scenario. If you're confused, please google "how to install imagemagick (your operating system here)"


=== 2. Download & extract the latest release ===

All releases are stored as tar / gzipped files here:
http://code.google.com/p/substruct/downloads/list

They are marked with version numbers. Grab the latest one and extract it using TAR or a similar utility.

If you don't know how to extract tarred/gzipped files [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+i+extract+tar+gz+file please go google that].

=== 3. Edit your database.yml file ===

You'll need to have a running database to use Substruct.

  * We develop against MySQL v5.x
    * MySQL v6 is not tested or supported at the current time
  * PostgreSQL has been rumored to work, but nobody on the core team tests against it.

We recommend the following database setup:

 * substruct_development
 * substruct_test
 * substruct_production

Edit your database.yml file to make sure that Rails can access your database properly.
For more information on the database.yml file, visit this url: http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/database.yml

=== 4. Compile vendored gems ===

Substruct stores required gem files in the vendor/gems folder for ease of installation.
This means you don't have to require the gems, but you still have to build them for your native platform.

Run the following command.

{{{

rake gems:build

}}}

=== 4. Initialize your database ===

Run this command from inside the substruct directory you extracted previously

{{{

rake db:create
rake substruct:db:bootstrap

}}}

== Usage ==

Fire up your environment!

{{{

ruby script/server

}}}

Try to login to http://localhost:3000/admin as ''admin'' / ''admin''

=== Misc ===

If you're going to be doing credit card transactions you need a processor account. [AuthorizeNet Check out how to get one.]
